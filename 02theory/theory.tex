\chapter{The standard model of particle physics}
\label{chap:SM}

The following chapter gives an overview about the fundamental particles and how they interact with each other. Therefore first
the the elementary particles and forces are described following Refs.~\cite{Griffiths:111880} and \cite{Perkins:396126}. Following
a short illustration how mediator particles emerge in the \ac{SM} is given and discrete symmetries in the \ac{SM} are introduced.
Last a more detailed discussion of the weak force is presented.

\section{Fundamental particles and forces}
\label{sec:fundamentalparts}

The \ac{SM} is a relativistic quantum field theory in which particles are produced and destroyed with fields $\phi(x)$ and the
dynamics is described through Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\left(\phi(x),\partial_{\mu}\phi(x)\right)$. In total \num{12} fundamental
particles with halfinteger spin exist: six quarks and six leptons. These \num{12} so-called fermions form all matter. Forces
between the fermions are mediated by bosons which have integer spin. A graphical representation of all fundamental particles is
shown in Fig.~\cref{fig:SMparts}).

Both quarks and leptons are classified in three families, where each family comprises a duplet of two particles. Further the quarks
are divided into up- and down-type quarks. The up-type quarks are the up- (\uquark), charm- (\cquark) and top-quark (\tquark), having
an electrical charge of $+\frac{2}{3}e$, the down-type quarks are the down- (\dquark), strange- (\squark) and bottom-quark (\bquark)
carrying an electrical charge of $-\frac{1}{3}e$. The six leptons are classified by their electrical charge. The electron  (\electron),
muon (\muon) and tauon (\tauon) have an electrical charge of $-1e$, whereas the corresponding neutrinos (\neue, \neum, \neut) are
uncharged. All \num{12} fermions have an antiparticle with opposite charge. This differentiation is also denoted as flavour for the
quarks.

As previously mentioned the fundamental forces in the \ac{SM} are mediated by particles with integer spin The so-called gauge bosons
can be directly associated with these forces.

The strong force is mediated by eight massless gluons $g$ which couple to colour. Beside the gluons the only particles carrying
colour are the quarks. Possible colours are red, green and blue and in addition three anticolours. Particles carrying colour
cannot exist as isolated particles, but have to form bounded states. Hence quarks cannot be observed individually but only in multi-quark
states. Most common three quarks (antiquarks) form a baryon (antibaryon), where each quark carries one of the three colours, or a quark
and an antiquark form a meson, where the antiquark carries the anticolour of the corresponding colour of the quark. As gluons carry
a colour and an anticolour, self-couplings are allowed in the \ac{SM} as well.

The electromagnetic interaction is mediated by the photon \g which couples to electric charge. Accordingly the only particles not affected
by the electromagnetic force are the uncharged neutrinos. Photons are also uncharged and thus do not couple to themselves.

The last interaction described in the \ac{SM} is the weak interaction. It is mediated by the uncharged \Z-boson and the charged
\Wpm-bosons. In contrast to the gluons and the photon these are massive particles with masses of $M_\W\approx\SI{80}{\gevcc}$ and
$M_Z\approx\SI{91}{\gevcc}$. They couple to all \num{12} fermions.

The last gauge boson is the Higgs-boson \H which was discovered in \num{2012} \cite{higgs_atlas, higgs_found}. It is the mediator of the
Higgs field and interacts with all massive particles. It has a mass of $M_\H\approx\SI{125}{\gevcc}$ \cite{PDG_2017}.

\section{Symmetries in the standard model}
\label{sec:symmetriesInSM}

The \ac{SM} distinguishes between discrete and continous gauge symmetries. The contious gauge symmetries require local invariance what
leads to the interactions in the corresponding symmetry groups U(1) (electromagentic interaction), SU(2) (weak interaction) and SU(3)
(strong interaction). The gauge bosons act as generators of the corresponding gauge transformation. This is illustrated for the U(1)
group. The Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\overline{\psi}\left(i\slashed{\partial} - m\right)\psi
- \frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} - \underbrace{eQ\overline{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi}_{j^{\mu}}A_{\mu}
\end{equation}
is invariant under the transformation
\begin{align}
\psi\rightarrow\psi'=e^{-ieQ\theta\left(x\right)}\psi\\
A_\mu\rightarrow A_\mu'=A_\mu+\partial_\mu\theta.
\end{align}
Hereby the gauge field $A_\mu$ can be identified with the photon and the interaction current $j^\mu A_\mu$ can be tracked down. Requiring
equivalent gauge transformations for the higher symmetry groups further gauge bosons are produced.

Apart of these continous symmetries there are also three discrete symmetries in the \ac{SM}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item parity $P$ describes spacial inversion $P\psi\left(t,\vec{x}\right) = \psi\left(t,-\vec{x}\right)$. The operator
		is unitary, so $P^{\dagger}=P^{-1}$ holds.
	\item the charge conjugation $C$ changes the sign of all additive quantum numbers. As the parity operator, $C$ is unitary as well. Both
		operations together change matter to antimatter.
	\item The third discrete symmetry is the time inversion $T$. It changes the time of all temporal components
		$T\psi\left(t,\vec{x}\right) = \psi\left(-t,\vec{x}\right)$. In contrast to $P$ and $C$ the operator is not unitary, but anit unitary,
		\ie $T^2=1$.
\end{itemize}
All discrete symmetries are violated both uniquely and in combination with any other discrete symmetry operation ($PT$, $CT$, $CP$) by the weak
interaction, while the strong and electromagnetic interaction are symmetry conserving. Only the combination of all three symmetry operations
$CPT$ is also conserved in the weak interaction. Due to this particles and antiparticles have the same invariant mass and lifetime.

\section{The Unitarity triangle}
\label{sec:unitarityTriangle}

As described in \cref{sec:symmetriesInSM} the weak interaction has a special status in the \ac{SM} by breaking the symmetry of the discrete
transformations. This symmetry breaking effect becomes more obvious when considering that the weak interaction only couples to the left handed
duplets of the quarks and leptons. For the leptons the eigenstates of the weak interaction can be transformed into the eigensystem of the mass
eigenstates assuming massless neutrinos. For the quarks this is not possible for both the Up- and Down-type quarks. By connvention the Up-type
quarks are chosen, so that the mass eigenstates of the down-type quarks \dquark, \squark and \bquark need to be transformed into the eigenstates
of the wek interaction \dquark', \squark' and \bquark':
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark' \\ \squark' \\ \bquark' \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \Vud & \Vus & \Vub \\ \Vcd & \Vcs & \Vcb \\ \Vtd & \Vts & \Vtb \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark \\ \squark \\ \bquark \end{pmatrix}
\approx \begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{\lambda^2}{2} & \lambda & A\lambda^3(\rho-i\eta) \\
                        -\lambda & 1-\frac{\lambda^2}{2} & A\lambda^2 \\
                        A\lambda^3(1-\rho-i\eta) & -A\lambda^2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark' \\ \squark' \\ \bquark' \end{pmatrix} \label{eq:CKMmatrix}
\end{equation}
This so called $CKM$ matrix has four degrees of freedom and needs to be unitary by construction. As shown in Eq.~\cref{eq:CKMmatrix} the matrix
elements can be parametrised in the Wolfenstein parametrisation with three real paramters ($A\approx0.81$, $\lambda\approx0.22$,
$\rho\approx0.13$ \cite{PDG_2017}) and one complex phase ($\eta\approx0.36$ \cite{PDG_2017}). It can be seen that the matrix elements become
smaller with larger distance to the diagonal.

The unitarity of the matrix allows now put some constraints on the matrix elements:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} V_{{\kern -0.1em}ij}V_{{\kern -0.1em}ik}^{*} = \delta_{jk}\hspace{0.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{0.5cm}
\sum_{j} V_{{\kern -0.1em}ij}V_{{\kern -0.1em}kj}^{*} = \delta_{ik}
\end{equation}
These equations can be expressed as triangles in the complexe plane. The most commonly used equation is
\begin{equation}
\Vud\Vubst + \Vcd\Vcbst + \Vtd\Vtbst = 0.
\end{equation}
Normalising it with \Vcd\Vcbst the triangle presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ckmtheory} is obtained:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Vud\Vubst}{\Vcd\Vcbst} + 1 + \frac{\Vtd\Vtbst}{\Vcd\Vcbst} = 0.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[tbp]

	\caption{$CKM$ triangle in the complex plane.}
	\label{fig:ckmtheory}
\end{figure}
This representation allows a nice experimental tests of the \ac{SM} by overconstraining the triangle with measurements of all three
angles and sides of the triangle.
