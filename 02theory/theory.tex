\chapter{The standard model of particle physics}
\label{chap:SM}

The following chapter gives an overview about the fundamental particles and how they interact with each other.
Therefore first the the elementary particles and forces are described following Refs.~\cite{Griffiths:111880}, \cite{Perkins:396126} and \cite{Peskin:257493}.
Following a short illustration how mediator particles emerge in the \ac{SM} is given and discrete symmetries in the \ac{SM} are introduced.
Last a more detailed discussion of the weak force is presented.

\section{Fundamental particles and forces}
\label{sec:fundamentalparts}

The \ac{SM} is a relativistic quantum field theory in which particles are produced and destroyed with fields $\phi(x)$ and the dynamics is described through Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\left(\phi(x),\partial_{\mu}\phi(x)\right)$.
In total \num{12} fundamental particles with halfinteger spin exist: six quarks and six leptons.
These \num{12} so-called fermions form all matter.
Forces between the fermions are mediated by bosons which have integer spin.
A graphical representation of all fundamental particles is shown in \cref{fig:SMparts}).

Both quarks and leptons are classified in three families, where each family comprises a duplet of two particles.
Further the quarks are divided into up- and down-type quarks. The up-type quarks are the up- (\uquark), charm- (\cquark) and top-quark (\tquark), having an electrical charge of $+\frac{2}{3}e$, the down-type quarks are the down- (\dquark), strange- (\squark) and bottom-quark (\bquark) carrying an electrical charge of $-\frac{1}{3}e$.
The six leptons are classified by their electrical charge.
The electron  (\electron), muon (\muon) and tauon (\tauon) have an electrical charge of $-1e$, whereas the corresponding neutrinos (\neue, \neum, \neut) are uncharged.
All \num{12} fermions have an antiparticle with opposite charge.
This differentiation is also denoted as flavour for the quarks.

As previously mentioned the fundamental forces in the \ac{SM} are mediated by particles with integer spin The so-called gauge bosons can be directly associated with these forces.

The strong force is mediated by eight massless gluons $g$ which couple to colour.
Beside the gluons the only particles carrying colour are the quarks. Possible colours are red, green and blue and in addition three anticolours.
Particles carrying colour cannot exist as isolated particles, but have to form bounded states.
Hence quarks cannot be observed individually but only in multi-quark states.
Most common three quarks (antiquarks) form a baryon (antibaryon), where each quark carries one of the three colours, or a quark and an antiquark form a meson, where the antiquark carries the anticolour of the corresponding colour of the quark.
As gluons carry a colour and an anticolour, self-couplings are allowed in the \ac{SM} as well.

The electromagnetic interaction is mediated by the photon \g which couples to electric charge.
Accordingly the only particles not affected by the electromagnetic force are the uncharged neutrinos.
Photons are also uncharged and thus do not couple to themselves.

The last interaction described in the \ac{SM} is the weak interaction.
It is mediated by the uncharged \Z-boson and the charged \Wpm-bosons.
In contrast to the gluons and the photon these are massive particles with masses of $M_\W\approx\SI{80}{\gevcc}$ and $M_Z\approx\SI{91}{\gevcc}$.
They couple to all \num{12} fermions.

The last gauge boson is the Higgs-boson \H which was discovered in \num{2012} \cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012xdj}.
It is the mediator of the Higgs field and interacts with all massive particles.
It has a mass of $M_\H\approx\SI{125}{\gevcc}$ \cite{PDG_2017}.

\section{Symmetries in the standard model}
\label{sec:symmetriesInSM}

When discussing symmetries in the \ac{SM} continous gauge symmetries and discrete symmetries need to be distinguished.
Requiring local invariance by the continous gauge symmetries leads to the interactions in the corresponding groups $U(1)$ (electromagnetic interaction), $SU(2)$ (weak interaction) and $SU(3)$ (strong interaction).
In this instance the gauge bosons act as generators of the gauge transformation.
This is exemplified for the $U(1)$ group, where the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\overline{\psi}\left(i\slashed{\partial} - m\right)\psi
- \frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} - \underbrace{eQ\overline{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi}_{j^{\mu}}A_{\mu}
\end{equation}
is invariant under the transformation
\begin{align}
\psi\rightarrow\psi'=e^{-ieQ\theta\left(x\right)}\psi\\
A_\mu\rightarrow A_\mu'=A_\mu+\partial_\mu\theta.
\end{align}
Recognising the gauge field $A_\mu$ as the photon the interaction term $j^\mu A_\mu$ can be identified.
For the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups equivalent transformations yield to the weak and strong interaction, respectively, and the \Wpm and \Z and the gluons act as generators.

Beside of these continous symmetries there are also three discrete symmetries in the \ac{SM}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The parity operator $P$ should reverse the moemntum wihtout flipping the spin of a particle.
		Hence, it describes spacial inversion $P\psi\left(t,\vec{x}\right) = \psi\left(t,-\vec{x}\right)$.
		It is unitary, so $P^{\dagger}=P^{-1}$ holds.
	\item The charge conjugation $C$ transforms particles into their corresponding antiparticles.
		Its name is slightly misleading as the operator reverses not only the electric charge but changes also the sign of all internal quantum numbers.
		It is also unitary.
	\item The third discrete symmetry is the time reversal $T$.
		It changes the sign of all temporal components $T\psi\left(t,\vec{x}\right) = \psi\left(-t,\vec{x}\right)$.
		Contrary to $P$ and $C$ the time reversal operator is not unitary, but antiunitary, \ie $T^2=1$.
\end{itemize}
All discrete symmetries are conserved by the strong and electromagnetic interaction while the weak interaction breaks them both,
indivudally and in combination with one other discrete symmetry ($PT$, $CT$, $CP$).
However based on the $CPT$ theorem the combination of all operations is an exact symmetry also for the weak interaction.
It assures that particles and antiparticles have the same invariant masses and lifetimes.

\section{The Unitarity triangle}
\label{sec:unitarityTriangle}

As explained previously the weak interaction plays a special role in the \ac{SM} by breaking the discrete symmetries.
Consequently the eigenstates to the weak interaction are not the same as the mass eigenstates.
Assuming the neutrinos to be massless, for the charged leptons a simple transformation can rotate the eigenstates to the weak interaction into the system of the mass eigenstates.
On the other hand this is not possible for the up- and downtype quarks at the same time.
By convention the weak eigenstates of the downtype quarks \dquark', \squark' and \bquark' are chosen to be mixtures of their mass eigenstates \dquark, \squark and \bquark:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark' \\ \squark' \\ \bquark' \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} \Vud & \Vus & \Vub \\ \Vcd & \Vcs & \Vcb \\ \Vtd & \Vts & \Vtb \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark \\ \squark \\ \bquark \end{pmatrix}
\approx \begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{\lambda^2}{2} & \lambda & A\lambda^3(\rho-i\eta) \\
                        -\lambda & 1-\frac{\lambda^2}{2} & A\lambda^2 \\
                        A\lambda^3(1-\rho-i\eta) & -A\lambda^2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \dquark' \\ \squark' \\ \bquark' \end{pmatrix} \label{eq:CKMmatrix}
\end{equation}
This so-called $CKM$ matrix has four degrees of freedom and is unitary by construction.
As shown in \cref{eq:CKMmatrix} the matrix elements can be parametrised in the Wolfenstein parametrisation with three real paramters ($A\approx0.81$, $\lambda\approx0.22$, $\rho\approx0.13$ \cite{PDG_2017}) and one complex phase ($\eta\approx0.36$ \cite{PDG_2017}).
It can be seen, that the matrix elements become smaller with greater distance to the diagonal and therefore transitions between the quark families are suppressed.

As a consequence of the unitarity of the matrix, its elements subject the following constraints:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} V_{{\kern -0.1em}ij}V_{{\kern -0.1em}ik}^{*} = \delta_{jk}\hspace{0.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{0.5cm}
\sum_{j} V_{{\kern -0.1em}ij}V_{{\kern -0.1em}kj}^{*} = \delta_{ik}.
\end{equation}
These equations can be represented as triangles in the complexe plane, which are of great importance in modern particle physics.
Their angles and sides can be measured experimentally so that the triangles can be overconstrained and the unitarity of the matrix can be tested.
Experimental hints of a non closing triangle would be a clear sign of physics beyond the \ac{SM}.
Additionally, the complex phase of the $CKM$ matrix is the only source of $CP$ violation in the \ac{SM}.
Therefore the size of the triangles is a measure for the theoretically described size of $CP$ violation.
The most commonly used equation is
\begin{equation}
\Vud\Vubst + \Vcd\Vcbst + \Vtd\Vtbst = 0.
\end{equation}
After normalising this with \Vcd\Vcbst the triangle
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Vud\Vubst}{\Vcd\Vcbst} + 1 + \frac{\Vtd\Vtbst}{\Vcd\Vcbst} = 0 \label{eq:CKMtriangle}
\end{equation}
as presented in \cref{fig:ckmtheory} is obtained.
Its angles can be parametrised using the CKM matrix elements in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\alpha&\equiv\arg\left(-\Vtd\Vub\Vtbst\Vudst\right)\\
\beta&\equiv\arg\left(-\Vcd\Vtb\Vcbst\Vtdst\right)\\
\gamma&\equiv\arg\left(-\Vud\Vcb\Vubst\Vcdst\right)\label{eq:CKMangles}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
