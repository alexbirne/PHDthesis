{$\symbfsf{C{}P}$ violation in the $\symbfsf{B}$-meson sector}
\label{chap:CPV}

Since $CPT$ is conserved in the \ac{SM} the violation of \CP is equivalent to a violation of the $T$ symmetry.
As described in \cref{sec:symmetriesInSM} the $T$ operator is antiunitary and therefore it transforms numbers into their complex conjugate.
Hence the \CP transformation also affects only the complex phases of the bras and kets describing initial and final states.
However the absolute values of phases describing transitions between different states are not physically meaningful as the bras and kets can be rephased at will.
The physical meaningful quantities are the relative phase differences between coherent contributions to a transition, as these are invariant under global rephasings.
There are three types of phases arising in transition amplitudes:
\emph{Weak} phases, which change sign under \CP transformation (\CP-odd), \emph{strong} phases, which do not change sign under \CP transformation (\CP-even) and \emph{spurious} phases, which usually arise due to conventional rephasings.
The denotations \emph{weak} and \emph{strong} do not mean that the phases originate in weak or strong interactions, but only describe their behaviour under \CP transformation.
Spurious phases are global and just arise due to conventional rephasings.
As they do not originate in any dynamics they will be ignored below for simplification.
Consequently the \CP transformation of the initial and final states are defined with \emph{weak} phases $\xi_i$ and $\xi_f$ as follows
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\CP\left|\Bz\right> =e^{i\xi}\left|\Bzb\right>&&\CP\left|\Bzb\right>=e^{-i\xi}\left|\Bz\right>&\\
&\CP\left|\,\f\,\right> =e^{i\xi_f}\left|\,\fbar\,\right>&&\CP\left|\,\fbar\,\right>=e^{-i\xi_f}\left|\,\f\,\right>.& \label{eq:CPTransInitFinal}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In this chapter first the time evolution of neutral mesons is described.
Following this formalism is applied to the \Bz-\Bzb mixing and then the three classes of \CP violation are discussed.
More details on these topics can be found in Refs.~\cite{Branco:396964,Bigi:1295518}

\section[head={Time evolution of neutral mesons},tocentry={Time evolution of neutral mesons}]{Time evolution of neutral mesons}
\label{sec:TimeEvolution}

As previously described in \cref{sec:unitarityTriangle} for the quarks the mass eigenstates and the eigenstates of the weak interaction are not identical.
The same applies for bound states of quarks like \B-mesons.
Studying the system of a neutral particle \Paz and its antiparticle \Pazb, the most general description to determine the time evolution is the Schrödinger equation:
\begin{equation}
i\frac{d}{dt}\begin{pmatrix} \Paz \\ \Pazb \end{pmatrix} = H \begin{pmatrix} \Paz \\ \Pazb \end{pmatrix}
=\left(M-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma\right)\begin{pmatrix} \Paz \\ \Pazb \end{pmatrix}, \label{eq:mixMatrix}
\end{equation}
with $M$ and $H$ being 2x2 hermitian 2x2 matrices.
Hence, the matrix $H$ is not hermitian and allows the \B mesons to decay and not just to oscillate.
In possible transitions virtual intermediate states contribute to the matrix $M$ while real physical states to which \Paz and \Pazb decay contribute to the matrix $\Gamma$.
Furthermore, as due to the $CPT$ theorem particle and antiparticles have the same masses and decay widths the following constraints apply for the matrix elements:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&m_{11}=m_{22}\equiv m&&m_{12}=m_{21}^\ast&\\
&\Gamma_{11}=\Gamma_{22}\equiv\Gamma&&\Gamma_{12}=\Gamma_{21}^\ast&
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Interpreting \Paz and \Pazb as two states distinguished by an internal quantum number $N_\quark$ the matrix elements can also be classified by certain types of transitions:
transitions with $\Delta N_\quark=1$ are driven by the diagonal elements, while the off diagonal elements are describe with $\Delta N_\quark=2$.
These $\Delta N_\quark=2$ processes describe so-called particle-antiparticle-oscillations.

To solve \cref{eq:mixMatrix} and infer the time evolution the matrix $H$ needs to be diagonalised to obtain the mass eigenstates and the corresponding eigenvalues.
These eigenstates can have different masses and lifetimes, however the absolute sign of the mass difference \dm or decay-width difference \DG has no physical meaning, as interchanging the two eigenstates would lead to $\dm\to-\dm$ and $\DG\to-\DG$.
Instead only the relative sign between both quantities is of physical interest.
With regard to the \Bz-meson system, where the eigenstates have quite different masses, in the following the mass eigenstates are denoted with $P_\text{H}$ and $P_\text{L}$, referring to the heavier and lighter eigenstate, respectively.
Using
\begin{equation}
F=\sqrt{\left(m_{12}-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}\right)\left(m_{12}^\ast-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}^\ast\right)}.
\end{equation}
the eigenvalues can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mu_\text{H} &= m_\text{H}-\frac{i}{2}\GH = m + \mathcal{Re}\left(F\right)-\frac{i}{2}\left(\Gamma-2\mathcal{Im}\left(F\right)\right)\\
\mu_\text{L} &= m_\text{L}-\frac{i}{2}\GL = m - \mathcal{Re}\left(F\right)-\frac{i}{2}\left(\Gamma+2\mathcal{Im}\left(F\right)\right)\label{eq:Mass_eigenvalues}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with the eigenstates
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left|B_\text{H}\right>&= p\left|\Paz\right>+q\left|\Pazb\right>\\
\left|B_\text{L}\right>&= p\left|\Paz\right>-q\left|\Pazb\right>.\label{eq:Mass_eigenstates}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The parameters $p$ and $q$ are constrained to fulfil $\left|p\right|^2+\left|q\right|^2=1$ by construction and their ratio $\frac{q}{p}$ can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements:
\begin{equation}
\frac{q}{p}=\sqrt{ \frac{ m_{12}^\ast-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}^\ast }{ m_{12}-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12} }}
=\frac{\dm-\frac{i}{2}\DG}{2\left(m_{12}-\frac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}\right)}.\label{eq:qoverp}
\end{equation}
Using the mass eigenvalues from \cref{eq:Mass_eigenvalues} and mass eigenstates from \cref{eq:Mass_eigenstates} and the Schrödinger equation can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
i\frac{d}{dt}\begin{pmatrix} P_\text{L} \\ P_\text{H} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mu_\text{L} & 0 \\ 0 & \mu_\text{H} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} P_\text{L} \\ P_\text{H} \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
which can be easily solved and leads to the time evolution of the mass eigenstates with simple exponential functions $P_\text{L,H}=e^{-i\mu_\text{L,H}t}P_\text{L,H}$.
Inverting \cref{eq:Mass_eigenstates} the time evolution for the flavour eigenstates follows straightforward:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left|\Paz\!\left(t\right)\right>&=\left|\Paz\right>g_+-\frac{q}{p}\left|\Pazb\right>g_-\\
\left|\Pazb\!\left(t\right)\right>&=\left|\Pazb\right>g_--\frac{p}{q}\left|\Paz\right>g_+ \label{eq:timeEvolution}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with $g_\pm=\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{-i\mu_\text{H}t}\pm e^{-i\mu_\text{L}t}\right)$.
The associated masses and decay widths of the eigenstates of the weak interaction can be written as
\begin{equation}
m=\frac{m_\text{L}+m_\text{H}}{2}\hspace{0.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{0.5cm}\Gamma=\frac{\GL+\GH}{2}.
\end{equation}
The corresponding differences will be referred to as
\begin{equation}
\dm=m_\text{H}-m_\text{L}=2\mathcal{Re}\left(F\right)\hspace{0.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{0.5cm}\DG=\GL-\GH=4\mathcal{Im}\left(F\right),
\end{equation}
to match the convention used by \ac{HFLAV}~\cite{HFLAV2016}.

\section[head={\Bz-\Bzb mixing},tocentry={\Bz-\Bzb mixing}]{$\symbfsf{\Bz}$-$\symbfsf{\Bzb}$ mixing}
\label{sec:BBbarMixing}

As described above the mixing of the flavour eigenstates \Bq and \Bqb are characterised by mass difference \dm, the decay-width difference \DG and the ratio $\nicefrac{q}{p}$ the paramters.
All of these quantities are connected to the off-diagonal matrix elements $m_{12}-\nicefrac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}$, hence $m_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$ must be calculated to further probe mixing phenomena.
In the \ac{SM} transitions from \Bq to \Bqb mesons can only happen through $\Delta F=2$ which can be further separated into transitions happening at quark-level (short-distance transitions) and transitions at hadron-level (long-distance transitions).

In the \ac{SM} long-distance transitions are expected to be negligible in the \Bq-\Bqb system due to the large mass of the \bquark-quark.

Transitios at quark-level, at lowest order, can be represented by Feynman-diagrams as shown in \cref{fig:FeynmanMixing}.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includestandalone{03CPV/figs/Bmixing_1}
	\hspace{0.5cm}
	\includestandalone{03CPV/figs/Bmixing_2}
	\caption{Box diagrams of lowest order for the \Bz-\Bzb-oscillation. Both diagrams are dominated by the \tquark-quark \cite{Ellis:2016jkw}.}
	\label{fig:FeynmanMixing}
\end{figure}
The first corresponding matrix element $m_{12}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
m_{12}=-\frac{G_{\text{F}}^2M_\W^2}{12\pi^2}f^2m_{\Bq}B\mathcal{F}^\ast \label{eq:monetwo}
\end{equation}
where $G_{\text{F}}$ is the Fermi constant, $M_\W$ the \W-boson mass, $f_K$ the weak interaction constant and $B$ the \emph{bag} parameter, which describes strong interaction effects~\cite{Branco:396964}.
The quantity $\mathcal{F}$ sums over the different box diagrams, containg a \uquark-, \cquark- or \tquark-quark, respectively.
Using the short notation $\lambda_i=V^{*}_{{\kern -0.1em}i\bquark}V_{{\kern -0.1em}i\quark}$ it can be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}=\eta_1\lambda_\cquark^2S_0\left(x_\cquark\right)+\eta_2\lambda_\tquark^2S_0\left(x_\tquark\right)
+2\eta_3\lambda_{\cquark}\lambda_{\tquark}S_0\left(x_\cquark,x_\tquark\right).
\end{equation}
Here $\eta_i$ are QCD correction factors and $S_0$ are the Inami-Lin functions~\cite{Inami:1980fz}, which go with the up-type-quark masses through the ratio $x_\quark\equiv\nicefrac{m_\quark^2}{m_\W^2}$.
In case of $\quark=\dquark$ both $\lambda_\cquark$ and $\lambda_\tquark$ are of same magnitude $\lambda^3$, in case of $\quark=\squark$ both $\lambda_\cquark$ and $\lambda_\tquark$ are of same magnitude $\lambda^2$.
Hence the summand containing $S_0\left(x_\tquark\right)$ is dominant and with the replacement $\eta_2=\eta_\Bq$ one can approximate
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}\approx\eta_\Bq\lambda_\tquark^2S_0\left(x_\tquark\right).
\end{equation}

The second matrix element $\Gamma_{12}$ corresponding to the short-distance transitions is given by
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{12}=\sum_f\left<\,\f\,\Big|T\Big|\Bq\right>^\ast\left<\,\f\,\Big|T\Big|\Bqb\right>.\label{eq:gamma12}
\end{equation}
Here \f describes the possible physical states to which \Bq and \Bqb decay.
As the mass of the \quark-quark is much larger than the mass of any \B meson, \Bq and \Bqb cannot decay in any \tquark-hadron.
Therefore the contributing diagrams to \cref{eq:gamma12} must be dominated by the available mass, \ie by $m_\Bq$.

Consequently the off-diagonal matrix elements $m_{12}-\nicefrac{i}{2}\Gamma_{12}$ are clearly dominated by $m_{12}$ as
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{\Gamma_{12}}{m_{12}}\right|\propto\frac{m_\Bq^2}{m_\tquark^2}\propto10^{-3}.\label{eq:m12vsG12}
\end{equation}
This can be used to derive a prediction about relative size of \DG compared to \dm.
The difference between the mass eigenvalues $\mu_\text{H}$ and $\mu_\text{L}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\Delta\mu=\mu_\text{H}-\mu_\text{L}=\dm-\frac{i}{2}\DG=2F.
\end{equation}
Squaring this and separating the real and imaginary parts leads to
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dm^2-\frac{1}{4}\DG^{\kern 3.4pt2}&=4\left|m_{12}\right|^2-\left|\Gamma_{12}\right|^2\\
\dm\DG&=4\mathcal{Re}\left(m_{12}^\ast\Gamma_{12}\right).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Taking into account the GIM-enhancement of $m_{12}$ and the bound on $\Gamma_{12}$ to be of order $m_\Bq$ (\cref{eq:m12vsG12}) this can be simplied to
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dm&\approx2\left|m_{12}\right|\\
\DG&\approx\frac{2\mathcal{Re}\left(m_{12}^\ast\Gamma_{12}\right)}{\left|m_{12}\right|},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
what shows that for the B-system the decay width difference is expected to be much smaller than the mass difference.

Applying the reasoning from \cref{eq:m12vsG12} further the ratio $\nicefrac{q}{p}$ it can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\frac{q}{p}\approx\frac{\left|m_{12}\right|}{m_{12}}=\frac{m_{12}^\ast}{\left|m_{12}\right|},
\end{equation}
\ie the quantity $\nicefrac{q}{p}$ is a pure phase.
Using \cref{eq:monetwo} the ratio can be connected to the CKM matrix elements:
\begin{equation}
\frac{q}{p}\approx-\frac{\Vtbst V_{\tquark\quark}}{\Vtb V_{\tquark\quark}^\ast}.\label{eq:qoverpCKM}
\end{equation}
Here the CKM combination $\Vtbst V_{\tquark\quark}$ appears because the box diagrams for $m_{12}$ shown in \cref{fig:FeynmanMixing} are dominated by the top-quark contribution as explained above.

\section[head={Classes of \CP violation},tocentry={Classes of \CP violation}]{Classes of $\symbfsf{C{}P}$ violation}
\label{sec:CPVClasses}

Depending on the type of transition in which \CP violation occurs, its manifestation is different, yielding in three classes.
Transitions with purely $\Delta N_\quark=1$ are affected by the so-called direct \CP violation, in transitions with $\Delta N_\quark=2$ \CP violation in mixing can potentially be observed.
Transitions affected by both $\Delta N_\quark=1$ dynamics and $\Delta N_\quark=2$ dynamics can be additionally affected by the so-called interference \CP violation.
Using the following notation for the decay amplitudes
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Af = \left<\,f\,\Big|T\Big|\Bz\right>\hspace{1cm}\Afbar = \left<\,\fbar\,\Big|T\Big|\Bz\right>\\
\Abarf = \left<\,f\,\Big|T\Big|\Bzb\right>\hspace{1cm}\Abarfbar = \left<\,\fbar\,\Big|T\Big|\Bzb\right>
\end{split}
\end{equation}
these three types will be described in more detail below.


\subsection[head={Direct \CP violation},tocentry={Direct \CP violation}]{Direct $\symbfsf{C{}P}$ violation}
\label{sec:DirectCPV}

Direct \CP violation or \CP violation in decay means that a specific decay amplitude differs between the particle and its corresponding antiparticle.
It is the only type of \CP violation which can occur for charged particles.
Experimentally this can be measured with a \CP asymmetry like
\begin{equation}
A_{\CP}=\frac{\left|\left<\,\fbar\,|T|\,\Bzb\,\right>\right|^2-\left|\left<\,\f\,|T|\,\Bz\,\right>\right|^2}{\left|\left<\,\fbar\,|T|\,\Bzb\,\right>\right|^2+\left|\left<\,\f\,|T|\,\Bz\,\right>\right|^2} = \frac{\left|\,\nicefrac{\Abarfbar}{\Af}\,\right|^2-1}{\left|\,\nicefrac{\Abarfbar}{\Af}\,\right|^2+1}.
\end{equation}
Naively one could expect that it is sufficient that a single amplitude contributes to a transition.
But considering a decay with just one amplitude
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Af&=Ae^{i\left(\delta+\phi\right)}\\
\Abarfbar&=Ae^{i\left(\delta-\phi\right)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a real positive number, $\phi$ is the \emph{weak} phase and $\delta$ the \emph{strong} phase, it becomes immediately obvious that the quantity $\big|\,\Abarfbar\,\big|^2-\big|\,\Af\,\big|^2$ vanishes and therefore \CP is conserved.
When instead considering a decay with two contributing amplitudes with different \emph{weak} and \emph{strong} phases
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Af=A_1e^{i\left(\delta_1+\phi_1\right)}+A_2e^{i\left(\delta_2+\phi_2\right)}\\
\Abarfbar=A_1e^{i\left(\delta_1-\phi_1\right)}+A_2e^{i\left(\delta_2-\phi_2\right)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\CP violation becomes possible if both the \emph{weak} and the \emph{strong} phases differ:
\begin{equation}
\left|\,\Af\,\right|^2-\left|\,\Abarfbar\,\right|^2=-4A_1A_2\sin\left(\delta_1-\delta_2\right)\sin\left(\phi_1-\phi_2\right).
\end{equation}
For \B-mesons this has been measured by the \lhcb experiment in the decay modes $\Bz\to\Kp\pim$ and $\Bs\to\Km\pip$ \cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-018} to be
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A_{\CP}\left(\Bz\to\Kp\pim\right) &= -0.080\pm0.007\stat \pm 0.003\syst\\
A_{\CP}\left(\Bs\to\Km\pip\right) &= 0.27\pm0.04\stat \pm 0.01\syst
\end{split}
\end{equation}
what corresponds to a statistical significance of $10.5\sigma$ and $6.5\sigma$ for the \Bz and the \Bs mode, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:DirectCPV} shows the corresponding invariant mass spectra.
\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{03CPV/figs/DirectCPV.pdf}
	\caption{Invariant mass spectra obtained with the event selection for the best sensitivity on $A_{\CP}\left(\Bz\to\Kp\pim\right)$ (a,b) and $A_{\CP}\left(\Bs\to\Km\pip\right)$ (c,d).

\end{figure}


\subsection[head={Mixing \CP violation},tocentry={Mixing \CP violation}]{Mixing $\symbfsf{C{}P}$ violation}
\label{sec:MixingCPV}

Indirect \CP violation, also denoted as \CP violation in mixing implies that the transition probabilities for a \Bz-meson to oscilate into a \Bzb meson and vice versa are different.
As due to charge conservation mxing is only possible for uncharged mesons this type of \CP violation cannot occur for charged particles.
Using the time evolution from \cref{eq:timeEvolution} the probabilities of initially produced \Bz and \Bzb mesons to have oscillated within a proper-time $t$ are
\begin{align}
\left|\left<\Bz\Big|\Bzb\!\left(t\right)\right>\right|^2=\frac{1}{4}\left|\frac{p}{q}\right|^2
\left(e^{-\GH t}+e^{-\GL t}-2e^{\frac{1}{2}\left(\Gamma\right)t}\cos\left(\dm t\right)\right),\\
\left|\left<\Bzb\Big|\Bz\!\left(t\right)\right>\right|^2=\frac{1}{4}\left|\frac{q}{p}\right|^2
\left(e^{-\GH t}+e^{-\GL t}-2e^{\frac{1}{2}\left(\Gamma\right)t}\cos\left(\dm t\right)\right).
\end{align}
To obtain the same probabilities for both processes obviously
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{q}{p}\right|=\left|\frac{p}{q}\right| \Rightarrow \left|\frac{q}{p}\right|=1
\end{equation}
is required.
According to \cref{eq:qoverp} this means that indirect \CP violation occurs if the matrix elements $m_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$ have different complex phases.
The \CP asymmetry in case of indirect \CP violation can be defined as
\begin{equation}
A_{\CP}(t)=\frac{\Gamma\left(\Bz\to\Bzb\right) - \Gamma\left(\Bzb\to\Bz\right)}{\Gamma\left(\Bz\to\Bzb\right) + \Gamma\left(\Bzb\to\Bz\right)}
= \frac{1-\left|\nicefrac{p}{q}\right|^4}{1+\left|\nicefrac{p}{q}\right|^4}
\end{equation}
However, as neutral \B-mesons do not just oscillate but also decay this asymmetry can not be used directly to measure \CP violation in mixing.
Instead the \B-mesons need to be reconstructed in flavour specific decays, \ie only the transitions $\Bz\to\f$ and $\Bzb\to\fbar$, but not $\Bz\to\fbar$ and $\Bzb\to\f$ are allowed.
Thus the flavour of the meson at decay can be determined by final state and compared to the initial production flavour.
For the \Bz and \Bs meson system \CP violation in mixing has been measured to be negligible \cite{HFLAV2016} what is in good agreement with the \ac{SM} predictions.

\subsection[head={Interference \CP violation},tocentry={Interference \CP violation}]{Interference $\symbfsf{C{}P}$ violation}
\label{sec:InterferenceCPV}

So far \CP violation arising due to a clash between the phases of two interfering decay amplitudes or a clash between the phases of $m_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$ has been discussed.
The third possibility is a clash between the phase of $\nicefrac{q}{p}$ and the phase of the decay amplitude what results in the so-called interference \CP violation.
For this class of \CP violation decays of \Bz and \Bzb mesons into both the final state \f and its \CP-conjugate \fbar need to be considered.

Inverting the requirement for \CP violation in mixing shows that \CP is conserved when there is a phase $\xi'$ such that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
m_{12}^\ast &= e^{2i\xi'}m_{12}\\
\Gamma_{12}^\ast &= e^{2i\xi'}\Gamma_{12}\label{eq:CPconservationMixing}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
what leads directly to $\nicefrac{q^2}{p^2} = e^{2i\xi'}$.
Using \cref{eq:CPTransInitFinal} the \CP conjugated amplitudes \Abarfbar and \Afbar can be expressed as
\begin{align}
\Abarfbar&=e^{i\left(\xi_f-\xi\right)}\Af,\label{eq:amplitudetransformation_1}\\
\Afbar&=e^{i\left(\xi_f+\xi\right)}\Abarf.\label{eq:amplitudetransformation_2}
\end{align}
what leads to $\big|\,\Af\,\big|=\big|\,\Abarfbar\,\big|$ and $\big|\,\Abarf\,\big|=\big|\,\Afbar\,\big|$ after eliminating the phases and shows that these amplitudes are \CP conserving.
Combining \cref{eq:amplitudetransformation_1} and \cref{eq:amplitudetransformation_2} then leads to
\begin{equation}
\Af\,\Afbar=e^{2i\xi}\,\Abarfbar\,\Abarf\,.
\end{equation}
Under the assumption that the phase of $\nicefrac{q}{p}$ and the phases of the decay amplitudes do not clash, \ie $\xi=\xi'$, \CP is conserved and
\begin{equation}
\arg\left(\frac{p^2}{q^2}\Af \,\overline{\kern -1.0pt A\kern -1.0pt}_{\kern 1.0pt f}^\ast\,\Afbar\overline{\kern -1.0pt \,A\kern -1.0pt}_{\kern 2.5pt\overline{\kern -1.5pt f\kern 1.5pt}}^\ast\right)=0
\end{equation}
applies.
This can be reformulated using the parameters
\begin{equation}
\Lf=\frac{q}{p}\frac{\Abarf}{\Af}\hspace{0.5cm}\text{and}
\hspace{0.5cm}\Lfbar=\frac{p}{q}\frac{\Afbar}{\Abarfbar}.
\end{equation}
Even without \CP violation in decay or mixing ($\big|\Lf\big|=\big|\Lfbar\big| = \pm1$) \CP is not conserved in case of
\begin{equation}
	\arg\left(\Lf\right)-\arg\left(\Lfbar\right)\neq0. \label{eq:conditionCPV}
\end{equation}

This type of \CP violation was first measured by the \B-factories \babar \cite{Aubert:2001nu} and \belle \cite{Abe:2001xe}.
The most prominent measurement is probably the anlysis of the so-called golden mode \BdToJPsiKS to determine $\sin{}\left(2\beta\right)$.
For this decay channel the condition in \cref{eq:conditionCPV} can be simplified to $\arg\left(\Lf\right)\neq0$ as only one common finalstate for both \Bz and \Bzb exists.
Furthermore no \CP violation in decay and mixing is expected for the decay \BdToJPsiKS and with the current experimental precision $\DG=0$ can be assumed.
Therefore the \CP asymmetry can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
A_{\CP}(t)=\frac{\Gamma\left(\Bzb\to\jpsi\KS\right)-\Gamma\left(\BdToJPsiKS\right)}{\Gamma\left(\Bzb\to\jpsi\KS\right)+\Gamma\left(\BdToJPsiKS\right)}=\Sf\sin\left(\dmd t\right),
\end{equation}
with the parameter $\Sf=\sin{}\left(2\beta\right)$ (a more thoroughly description of the formalism will be given in \cref{ch:CKMAngleGamma}).
The most recent measurement of \Sf was performed by \lhcb \cite{Aaij:2015vza} yielding a result of
\begin{equation}
\Sf=0.731\pm0.035\stat\pm0.005\syst,
\end{equation}
what is consistent with the \ac{SM} expectations. The resulting \CP asymmetry is shown in \cref{fig:sin2beta}
