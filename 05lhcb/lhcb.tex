\chapter{The \lhcb experiment}

Along with \atlas, \cms and \alice, the \lhcb experiment is one of the four major experiments at the European nuclear research centre \cern.
The experiment is specialized on precision measurements of the physics of processes with \bquark and \cquark quarks.
The Large Hadron Collider (\lhc) is briefly described below, followed by a more detailed description of the \lhcb detector and its components (based on \cite{LHCbDetectorReference}).
At the end of this chapter \lhcb software stack will be described briefly
